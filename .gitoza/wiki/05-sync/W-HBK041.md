# Refresh and reindex

Gitoza keeps a **local SQLite index** for fast search. When files change outside the app (or the index looks wrong), use **Refresh**.

## When to refresh

- After `git pull` or edits in an IDE on the `gitoza` branch
- When search results or Library links look stale
- After upgrading Gitoza if docs mention a full reindex

## How

1. Click **Refresh** (workspace / title-bar control).
2. Prefer **Incremental Refresh** for normal Git updates.
3. Choose **Force Full Reindex** if tickets, wiki pages, or cases are missing from search after a major change.

## Sync vs refresh

| Action | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Sync** → Confirm Changes → Process | Push *your* local edits to the remote |
| **Refresh** | Pull / re-read remote or disk changes into the local index |
