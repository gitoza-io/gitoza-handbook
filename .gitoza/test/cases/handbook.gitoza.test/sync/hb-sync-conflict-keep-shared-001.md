# Resolve conflict with Keep shared

## Steps

1. On a **fork**, arrange overlapping edits so rebase (or merge) will conflict on a file.
2. Click **Sync** → **Confirm Changes** and enter the conflict resolution state.
3. For the conflicted file or hunk, choose **Keep shared** (incoming / theirs).
4. Finish any remaining conflicts and continue the sync.

## Expected Result

**Keep shared** applies the remote/shared version for that conflict. After all conflicts are resolved, sync continues ([[GITO-SYNC02]] AC-9–AC-11).
