# Confirm Changes starts the sync pipeline

## Steps

1. On a **fork**, create at least one unsynced local change and click **Sync**.
2. Review the grouped list and detail diffs.
3. Click **Confirm Changes** (or the equivalent confirm / **Process** action).

## Expected Result

Confirming starts the sync pipeline for the reviewed changes rather than only closing the review UI ([[GITO-SYNC02]] AC-7).
