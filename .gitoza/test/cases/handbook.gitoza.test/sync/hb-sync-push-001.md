# Successful sync pushes and clears local diffs

## Steps

1. On a **fork**, make a local change, click **Sync**, review diffs, and confirm.
2. Allow fetch/rebase to finish (resolve conflicts with Keep mine / Keep shared if needed).
3. Wait for the push step to complete.
4. Check workspace status and the remote `gitoza` branch.

## Expected Result

Gitoza **pushes** the rebased result to the remote. The UI returns to a clean workspace: diffs clear, **Sync** hides until new edits exist, and remote content matches what was confirmed ([[GITO-SYNC02]] AC-12–AC-13).
