# Sync run results to remote

## Steps

1. On a **fork** of this handbook, create a run and mark at least one Pass or Fail result.
2. Confirm the status dot shows **Editing — local changes not yet pushed**.
3. Click **Sync** → review the run diff in **Confirm changes** → **Process**.
4. Confirm **Sync complete** and the baseline (green) status.

## Expected Result

Run results are published to the remote `gitoza` branch as reviewable YAML. Upstream handbook is read-only — use your fork for this step.
